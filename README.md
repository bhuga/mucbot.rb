#### mucbot.rb by ben lavender 2008

mucbot.rb is a simple MUC bot that will relay messages sent to it to the configured MUC, including html messages.  This is useful for sending out notices to a workgroup.

An example notification script, based on an example script packaged with xmpp4r, will, after configuration, report updates to an SVN repository while making changesets and ticket numbers in the commit log work as links to a [trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) installation.
